## Prerequisites

- truffle 
- ganache cli

## Featured Technologies

**Solidty:** Is an object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts. It is used for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.

**Smart Contract:** Is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.

**Truffle migrate (Deploy):** Migrations are JavaScript files that help you deploy contracts to the Ethereum network. These files are responsible for staging your deployment tasks, and they're written under the assumption that your deployment needs will change over time. As your project evolves, you'll create new migration scripts to further this evolution on the blockchain.

**Ganache-dev:** Is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests.

**Truffle test:** Is an automated testing framework to make testing your contracts a breeze. This framework lets you write simple and manageable tests in two different ways:

-In Javascript and TypeScript, for exercising your contracts from the outside world, just like your application.

-In Solidity, for exercising your contracts in advanced, bare-to-the-metal scenarios.

**Postdeploy:**  Postdeploy is responsible for extracting build-generated information to create a contract.json file
